<p>IBM grants to YOU a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license
to make, use, sell, offer to sell or import the Original Code for use
in Licensed Code under any patents licensable by IBM (but only to the

<blockquote>
ii) YOUR Program includes more than 60% of the Original Code and such
portion of Original Code included in YOUR program is reachable during
normal operation of YOUR program.

action against such Contributor for intellectual property
infringement.

restriction associated with any part of YOUR Modification (including
a copy of any applicable license agreement).

<p> If YOU learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating
to the Program or to YOUR Modification, YOU shall promptly modify
