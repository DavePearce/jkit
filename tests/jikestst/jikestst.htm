<h3><a name="whatis"><b>What is the Jikes Test Suite</b></a></h3>

<p>We currently test new versions of the Jikes compiler using the following tests
<ul>
<li>The <code>derek</code> tests, written by Derek Lieber of IBM for testing a java virtual
machine he wrote early in 1996,</li>
<li>The <code>hpj</code> tests, written by members of the High Performance Compiler for
Java team.</li>,
<li>The <code>spec</code> tests, based on the program fragments in the
published Java Language Specification,</li>
<li>Version 2.1.1. of the Modena Test Suite,</li>
<li>The <code>lang</code> component of Sun's JCK test suite for JDK 1.1.4.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are releasing the <code>derek</code> and <code>hpj</code> tests
along with the source for the compiler to provide a rudimentary
regression test facility. We are not releasing the <code>spec</code>
tests as they may be covered by Sun's copyright. The licenses for the
Modena and JCK suites do not allow us to redistribute them.

<p>We are also releasing the <code>pr</code> tests. These are based
on the Problem Reports from 094 on that we have received this year.
The problem reports can be found in the <a
href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/syssftpr/JavaTech/Jikes.nsf">
Jikes Discussion Database</a>. 
The <code>pr</code> test suite is a work in progress and we welcome
volunteers who want to work with us to bring the test set to a usable
state.

<h3><a name="install"><b>How do I install the test environment?</b></h3>

<p> Compile the programs <code>jtarccat</code>, <code>jtarcget</code>
and <code>jtarcput</code>.  We suggest adding
<code>jikestst/bin</code> to your <code>PATH</code>; otherwise, you
will need to put copies of the scripts and executables to a directory
on your <code>PATH</code>.

<pre>
    cd jikestst/bin
    make
</pre>

<h3><a name="use"><b>How are the tests organized?</b></a></h3>

<p>We use a number of small scripts to run the tests and analyze the
results, and a few programs to manipulate the files involved. These
can be found in the <code>jikestst/bin</code> directory.

<p>Not all the scripts supplied will be needed. We are providing the
<code>jtm</code> and <code>jsm</code> scripts used to run large sets
of tests, as they may be needed as our test suite grows.

<p>Tests are described using a description file, with suffix
<code>d</code>, that serves as input to the test scripts. We
distinguish <code>c</code> (<code>comp</code>) tests which test
response to erroneous source, from <code>e</code> (<code>exec</code>)
tests which test correct translation by compilation and execution of
a test program (these tests always write something to standard
output, sometimes just <code>0</code> to indicate the program has
completed normally).

<h3><a name="scripts"><b>What are the test script commands?</b></h3>


<p> Tests are run using the <code>jt</code> script which takes as
input test description files with type <code>.d</code>.

<p> The <code>jt</code> script uses Jikes; <code>js</code> is
similar, but uses another compiler, usually Sun's <code>javac</code>,
for comparison purposes.

<p>The script <code>jtgen</code> is like <code>jt</code>; however,
while <code>jt</code> executes commands, <code>jtgen</code> just
writes out commands to be executed later. This is useful in debugging
multi-file tests.


<p>Suitable changes are probably needed for the definition of
<code>COMP</code> in the files <code>js</code>, <code>jt</code>,
<code>jsm</code> and <code>jtm</code> (unless your username happens
to be <code>shields</code>!).  

<p>The test scripts take as input a descriptor file for a set of tests.
Each line in the descriptor file has the form:
<pre>
    <code>command</code> <em>arguments</em>
</pre>
where the command and its arguments are separated by white space.
The supported commands are as follows:
<dl>
<dt><code>#</code>
<dd>comment
<dt><code>c</code> <em>file</em> <em>class</em>
<dd>copy source file <em>file</em><code>.java</code> to file local <em>class</em><code>.java</code>
    and compile it, saving compiler output in <em>file</em>.c
<dt><code>e</code> <em>file</em> <em>class</em>
<dd>    copy source file <em>file</em><code>.java</code> to local file <em>class</em><code>.java</code>
    compile it, and
    then execute <em>class</em>, saving output in <em>file</em><code>.e</code>

<dt><code>g</code> <em>file</em> <em>package</em> <em>class</em>
<dd>copy source file <em>file</em><code>.java</code> to <em>package</em>/<em>class</em><code>.java</code>
<dt><code>f</code> <em>package</em> <em>class</em>
<dd>
    compile <em>package</em>/<em>class</em><code>.java</code>, appending compiler output to
    <em>package</em><code>.c</code>
<dt><code>m</code> <em>name</em> <em>directory_list</em>
<dd>
    start multi-file test with name <em>name</em>, <em>directory_list</em> is a
    list of directories that should be created in an empty state.
<dt><code>Q</code>
<dd>quit
<dt><code>r</code> <em>directory-list</em>
<dd>erase each directory in the directory list
<dt><code>s</code> <em>directory</em>
<dd>set the directory to be searched for source files (default <code>../src</code>)
<dt><code>x</code> <em>name</em> <em>args</em>
<dd>execute <em>name</em><code>.class</code> with arguments <em>args</em>.
The default for <em>name</em> is <code>Test</code>.
</dl>

<p> The <code>c</code> and <code>e</code> commands are used for
single file tests. The arguments are the file name and an optional
class name. If the class name is not given, <code>Test</code> is
assumed. A <code>c</code> (or <code>comp</code>) test just compiles the file, an
<code>e</code> (or <code>exec</code>) test compiles a file and executes the resulting
class file.

<p>
Tests requiring more than one file take the form
<pre>
    <code>m</code> <em>name</em> <em>directories</em>
    <code>g ...
    f ...   
    x ...</code>
</pre>

<p> where the intial <code>m</code> command names the tests and gives
a list of directories needed if packages are involed. The
<code>g</code> command is used to copy the source files, and the
<code>f</code> command is used to compile them. The
<code>x</code> command is used to execute the program.


<h3><a name="run"><b>How do I run the tests and check the output?</b></h3>

<p>Run the tests as follows (be sure that the definition of <code>COMP</code> in <code>jt</code>
points to the executable that you are testing):
<pre>
    cd jikestst/derek/w
    make exec
    make chk
    cat exec.dif   // examine the output
    cd jikestst/hpj/w
    make exec
    make chk
    cat exec.dif   // examine the output
</pre>
Check the resulting <code>.dif</code> files for surprises.
You can clean up with "<code>make clean</code>".

<p>These tests are intended mainly for regression testing and are by
no means meant to be interpreted as a comprehensive test of
compliance or conformance.
