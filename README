The Java Compiler Kit is a straightforward implementation of a Java
compiler, designed with extensibility in mind. In building the JKit
compiler, the aims were: firstly, to help with teaching compilers by
considering an implementation for a fully fledged language (Java),
rather than a stripped-down imitation language; secondly, to aid
research in programming languages, compilers and verification. With
JKit you can easily prototype new extensions to the Java language, or
implement completely new languages and compile them down to Java
Bytecode.
